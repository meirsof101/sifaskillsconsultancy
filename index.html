      <h2 class="section-title">Our Founding Story</h2>
      <div class="founding-story">
        <div class="founding-story-content">
          <p>SifaSkills (EA) Ltd (SEAL) was born from a shared vision and a deep understanding of the challenges facing youth and businesses across East Africa. Our founders — seasoned experts in finance, human resources, and business development — consistently observed two critical gaps: students graduating with academic qualifications but lacking practical, employable skills; and startups and small businesses struggling to grow due to limited access to expert guidance and structured support.</p>
          <p>These gaps create a cycle where talented young people remain unemployed, while promising businesses operate below their potential. To break this cycle, we established SEAL, with a clear mission: to equip students and recent graduates with job-ready skills that prepare them for meaningful careers or entrepreneurial ventures, and to provide SMEs and startups with tailored consultancy services that improve structure, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.</p>
          <p>The name SEAL reflects our commitment to "sealing success" — connecting talent with opportunity, and turning knowledge into action.</p>
